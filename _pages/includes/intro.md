I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the joint program between the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/) and [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), co-supervised by [Prof. Qiang Huo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/qianghuo/) at MSRA and [Prof. Jun Du](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jundu/) at USTC. My Ph.D. research focuses on Document Intelligence (including OCR, document layout analysis, and document understanding) and Large Language Models (including MLLM, Agent, and RAG). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree from the School of the Gifted Young (a.k.a. Â∞ëÂπ¥Áè≠) at the University of Science and Technology of China in 2021, majoring in Computer Science.

During my Ph.D. studies, I gained valuable industry experience through internships at MSRA, DeepSeek, and ByteDance. At DeepSeek, I contributed to the development of DeepSeek VL2, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek R1. My internship at MSRA involved working on the [Microsoft OneOCR project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr) and the [Microsoft Document Intelligence project](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence) under the guidance of Researcher [Qiang Huo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/qianghuo/) and [Lei Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cUfOZxQAAAAJ&hl=en). Most recently, I began an internship with the [ByteDance Seed team](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/), where I am working on LLM/MLLM Agent projects. I have published over 10 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKT0Vg4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FJarvisUSTC%2Fjarvisustc.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at top-tier international AI journals and conferences.
